# Edit Distance Project - Gene Comparison using Needleman-Wunsch Algorithm

Welcome to the **Edit Distance** project! This project utilizes the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to calculate the minimum edit distance between two genes, helping to uncover the minimal genetic differences.


## Introduction


The **Edit Distance** project focuses on harnessing the power of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to analyze the genetic similarity between two genes. By identifying the minimum number of operations required to transform one gene sequence into another, this project aids in understanding genetic mutations and variations.
